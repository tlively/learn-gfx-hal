# Textures

You can draw a lot with just triangles and colors. Do a search for "low poly
art" and you'll find a bunch of stuff that's just lots and lots of color shaded
triangles. Like the digital version of stained glass art. It's really cool.

But you can't make Skyrim or Smash Bros with just colored triangles. At some
point you want to stick a picture of a thing on those triangles. A picture that
you place onto a model is called a "texture", even though really it's just a
normal image. In fact, you can use `gfx-hal` to render into an image, then keep
that image around and use it to texture your models.

A picture has "pixels", and sometimes you'll hear about a texture having
"texels". Just a way that some people distinguish between images intended for
final use and images intended for placement onto a model. The thing that's the
most special about textures is that since X, Y, and Z are already being used for
3D spatial positioning of a vertex, the position within a texture that it maps
to is called U and V. This is called [UV
Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping) and it can get very
complicated if you have a single texture being wrapped around a 3D model.

As always, each stage of this is hard enough already, so we'll keep it simple.
This time out we're going to place a texture onto a "Quad" (two triangles
oriented to make a quadrilateral). Like before, part of the quad will follow the
mouse so that we can see it stretch around and even flip backwards when the
mouse moves "behind" the start of the quad.

What picture? Well I've drawn a pic of a friendly water pal in MS Paint, just
for this occasion. Here's a quarter-size sample:

![creature-smol](images/creature-smol.png)

# Making A Quad

So instead of having a `Triangle` type, we're going to have a `Quad` type. What
makes up a quad? Of course it's four points instead of three.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct Quad {
  pub x: f32,
  pub y: f32,
  pub w: f32,
  pub h: f32,
}
```

So if we have four "real" points, and we want to make two triangles... well we
need 3 points per triangle... We could just list out some of the points more
than once (scrub mode) or we could get fancy in how we tell the GPU to do it and
kick it up to a technique called "Indexed Drawing" (cool mode). The details of
that will be covered in a moment, right now we need to have a method to turn a
quad into some vertex data.

```rust
impl Quad {
  pub fn vertex_attributes(self) -> [f32; 4 * (2 + 3 + 2)] {
    let x = self.x;
    let y = self.y;
    let w = self.w;
    let h = self.h;
    #[cfg_attr(rustfmt, rustfmt_skip)]
    [
    // X    Y    R    G    B                  U    V
      x  , y+h, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, /* red     */ 0.0, 1.0, /* bottom left */
      x  , y  , 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, /* green   */ 0.0, 0.0, /* top left */
      x+w, y  , 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, /* blue    */ 1.0, 0.0, /* bottom right */
      x+w, y+h, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, /* magenta */ 1.0, 1.0, /* top right */
    ]
  }
}
```

As you can see, we're approaching the limit of being able to specify it all as a
flat array. In future lessons we'll talk about having a proper Vertex type and
giving it fields so that it's easier to tell what parts are what and such. For a
single quad it's probably okay to do it like this.

So each vertex will have an XY position like before, and an RGB color like
before, and now we're adding a UV texture coordinate as well. We'll also have to
change around our pipeline setup to allow for the new vertex attribute.

Texture positions are always stored as 0.0 to 1.0 within the texture, U goes
horizontal (like X) and V is vertical (like Y). Within `gfx-hal`, the (0.0, 0.0)
position for UV coordinates is the **top left corner** of the image. Even if the
backend would normally use some other system, `gfx-hal` does the translations
necessary so that (0.0, 0.0) is the top left.

Note that some other graphics systems (mostly OpenGL) put the texture origin at
the _bottom_ left instead! If you're trying out some shader code samples from
some other place and your images come out unexpectedly upside down, that's why.
You can compensate by flipping the image data before you upload it (I'll mention
that in a moment), or you can flip the computed coordinate before looking up the
data in the texture by using `1.0-V` instead of using `V` directly.

# Indexed Drawing

Indexed drawing is a way to save on vertex space by specifying the minimum
number of vertices in just any order within an array, and then also specifying
indexes into that array to describe the triangles themselves.

That might sound silly, at first. We save a little space on the vertex data that
we didn't specify twice, but then we have to give all the indexes, so are we
really saving much? Let's check.

Say we have 28 bytes per vertex (7 floats * 4 bytes each, that's what we have
right now), and also that indexes are given as `u16` values:

* If there's a Quad:
  * We reduce the vertex count from 6 to 4 (56 bytes saved)
  * We need to spend 6 indexes to describe the triangles (12 bytes used)
  * Net savings of 44 bytes per quad (56-12)
* If there's a Cube:
  * We reduce the vertex count from 36 to 8 (784 bytes saved)
  * We need to spend 36 indexes to describe the triangles (72 bytes used)
  * Net savings of 712 bytes per cube (784-72)
* As the model shape gets more complex, causing more triangles to share the same
  vertex, the overall savings _improve_.

So, yeah, that's totally sweet.

## Making A `BufferBundle` Type

First of all, now that we're having more than one buffer, we want to take that
buffer creation (declare buffer, check requirements, get memory, bind memory)
and pack it into its own thing. We'll call it a `BufferBundle`, because that
seems like a good enough name for a really generic sort of thing that we don't
even fully know how we'll use in the future.

The struct for it is very simple. We can even make it generic over the `Backend`
trait for maximum angle brackets in our code. (Rust is always better with more
angle brackets in the types, right?)

```rust
pub struct BufferBundle<B: Backend, D: Device<B>> {
  pub buffer: ManuallyDrop<B::Buffer>,
  pub requirements: Requirements,
  pub memory: ManuallyDrop<B::Memory>,
  pub phantom: PhantomData<D>,
}
```

We'll make all the fields be `pub`, because (hot take) that's honestly the
better default for fields, unless you're trying to maintain some invariants with
the type. The `BufferBundle` isn't smart enough to have any invariants.

So we've got it generic over `Backend`, and then our methods will be using a
particular `Device`, and it'd be slightly insane to try and use a buffer between
two different device implementations, so we'll throw in a 👻
[PhantomData](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/marker/struct.PhantomData.html) 👻
so that things know we had a particular device in mind when we made the buffer.
Is there anything that PhantomData can't solve? I sure hope not. 👻

Do we want this type to have any methods? Yeah, obviously, we want to be able to
make new ones. We'll just cut that code for making the vertex buffer and then
make it a little more buffer agnostic and reusable.

```rust
impl<B: Backend, D: Device<B>> BufferBundle<B, D> {
  pub fn new(adapter: &Adapter<B>, device: &D, size: usize, usage: BufferUsage) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
    unsafe {
      let mut buffer = device
        .create_buffer(size as u64, usage)
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't create a buffer!")?;
      let requirements = device.get_buffer_requirements(&buffer);
      let memory_type_id = adapter
        .physical_device
        .memory_properties()
        .memory_types
        .iter()
        .enumerate()
        .find(|&(id, memory_type)| {
          requirements.type_mask & (1 << id) != 0 && memory_type.properties.contains(Properties::CPU_VISIBLE)
        })
        .map(|(id, _)| MemoryTypeId(id))
        .ok_or("Couldn't find a memory type to support the buffer!")?;
      let memory = device
        .allocate_memory(memory_type_id, requirements.size)
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't allocate buffer memory!")?;
      device
        .bind_buffer_memory(&memory, 0, &mut buffer)
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't bind the buffer memory!")?;
      Ok(Self {
        buffer: ManuallyDrop::new(buffer),
        requirements,
        memory: ManuallyDrop::new(memory),
        phantom: PhantomData,
      })
    }
  }
```

**Note:** In a program with many buffers you wouldn't want each buffer to be its
own memory allocation, because devices have a limit on the number of allocations
as well as on the total amount of allocated memory. However, implementing a
proper memory allocator is obviously way out of scope for right now, so we'll
just do the beginner thing.

Also we want to be able to throw them away when we're done. Question: Do we want
it to be `Drop`? Mmmm, no. But `HalState` is `Drop`, why not this too? Well,
`HalState` gets to be `Drop` because it's holding the `Device` field that's
needed to destroy all the other stuff it has. A `BufferBundle` has a PhantomData
for a device thing, but it isn't holding an _actual_ `Device`, so it can't
perform a `Drop` on its own. _Should_ it hold an actual device reference? I
think not. That'd make it really hard to store in our `HalState` alongside the
device field. The lifetimes would go crazy. So we'll just make a method to
`manually_drop` the type, and then it'll do the thing.

```rust
  pub unsafe fn manually_drop(&self, device: &D) {
    use core::ptr::read;
    device.destroy_buffer(ManuallyDrop::into_inner(read(&self.buffer)));
    device.free_memory(ManuallyDrop::into_inner(read(&self.memory)));
  }
}
```

## Adding `BufferBundle` To `HalState`

So now `HalState` wants two fields like this:

```rust
  vertices: BufferBundle<back::Backend, back::Device>,
  indexes: BufferBundle<back::Backend, back::Device>,
```

Lokathor, why did we make BufferBundle be all generic and not have HalState be
all generic?

Because I tried that at first and doing the whole `HalState` generic gave me
some trouble at the time, so I just gave up on it. Obviously.

Creating these buffers is pretty easy:

```rust
    const F32_XY_RGB_UV_QUAD: usize = size_of::<f32>() * (2 + 3 + 2) * 4;
    let vertices = BufferBundle::new(&adapter, &device, F32_XY_RGB_UV_QUAD, BufferUsage::VERTEX)?;

    const U16_QUAD_INDICES: usize = size_of::<u16>() * 2 * 3;
    let indexes = BufferBundle::new(&adapter, &device, U16_QUAD_INDICES, BufferUsage::INDEX)?;
```

And once we have an index buffer we can fill it up just once as part of our
`HalState` startup. Even if our quad changes from frame to frame, the indexes
don't, so we won't have to re-upload them each frame (the savings don't stop!)

```rust
    // Write the index data just once.
    unsafe {
      let mut data_target = device
        .acquire_mapping_writer(&indexes.memory, 0..indexes.requirements.size)
        .map_err(|_| "Failed to acquire an index buffer mapping writer!")?;
      const INDEX_DATA: &[u16] = &[0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0];
      data_target[..INDEX_DATA.len()].copy_from_slice(&INDEX_DATA);
      device
        .release_mapping_writer(data_target)
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't release the index buffer mapping writer!")?;
    }
```

This is the exact same idea as writing to the vertex buffer, so it should look
very familiar. Do we want to make a `write_stuff` method on the `BufferBundle`
type and capture this pattern? Hmmmmmm, maybe later. I don't think it'd be hard,
but it's not really our goal right now.

## Performing Indexed Drawing

When we're doing our command buffer encoding we do it just a little different.

Now we have to bind an index buffer (there's _just one_ index buffer per draw
call, even if there's more than one vertex buffer being combined)

```rust
        encoder.bind_index_buffer(IndexBufferView {
          buffer: &self.indexes.buffer,
          offset: 0,
          index_type: IndexType::U16,
        });
```

And then instead of calling `draw` with a vertex range, offset, and instance
range, we call `draw_indexed` with an index range, offset, and instance range.

```rust
        encoder.draw_indexed(0..6, 0, 0..1);
```

Like I said, it's only _slightly_ different.

# Adding A Vertex Attribute For Texture Positions

This is just a quick little bit. Since we've got a new vertex attribute, we need
to update our pipeline to account for it.

```rust
      let vertex_buffers: Vec<VertexBufferDesc> = vec![VertexBufferDesc {
        binding: 0,
        stride: (size_of::<f32>() * (2 + 3 + 2)) as ElemStride,
        rate: 0,
      }];
      let position_attribute = AttributeDesc {
        location: 0,
        binding: 0,
        element: Element {
          format: Format::Rg32Float,
          offset: 0,
        },
      };
      let color_attribute = AttributeDesc {
        location: 1,
        binding: 0,
        element: Element {
          format: Format::Rgb32Float,
          offset: (size_of::<f32>() * 2) as ElemOffset,
        },
      };
      let uv_attribute = AttributeDesc {
        location: 2,
        binding: 0,
        element: Element {
          format: Format::Rg32Float,
          offset: (size_of::<f32>() * 5) as ElemOffset,
        },
      };
      let attributes: Vec<AttributeDesc> = vec![position_attribute, color_attribute, uv_attribute];
```

Gosh, that's a very basic change. It's almost like [a macro could do
it](https://docs.rs/glium/0.23.0/glium/macro.implement_vertex.html). Naw, I'm
sure no one would ever [use a macro for
that](https://docs.rs/vulkano/0.11.1/vulkano/macro.impl_vertex.html). Never.

This is another reason why you want to switch to a proper "vertex type" as your
program grows bigger and bigger. It's not only easier to read, but you can start
throwing macros at your problems! We'll get there eventually.

# Loading An Image

I'm sorry ahead of time, but this process is a fiddly and long one compared to
how easy that index buffer thing is.

What we want is to take a collection of pixel data and get it form our CPU
memory into GPU memory. However, as much as you might think, "oh that's super
common, that's gotta be like 1 call right?" No, it's like 11 distinct steps,
some of which are several calls.

So, we'll make another type to hold this concept for us. This is very similar to
the BufferBundle, with some generics and PhantomData and such.

```rust
pub struct LoadedImage<B: Backend, D: Device<B>> {
  pub image: ManuallyDrop<B::Image>,
  pub requirements: Requirements,
  pub memory: ManuallyDrop<B::Memory>,
  pub image_view: ManuallyDrop<B::ImageView>,
  pub sampler: ManuallyDrop<B::Sampler>,
  pub phantom: PhantomData<D>,
}
```

And right now we can say that it's got a cleanup method too:

```rust
  pub unsafe fn manually_drop(&self, device: &D) {
    use core::ptr::read;
    device.destroy_sampler(ManuallyDrop::into_inner(read(&self.sampler)));
    device.destroy_image_view(ManuallyDrop::into_inner(read(&self.image_view)));
    device.destroy_image(ManuallyDrop::into_inner(read(&self.image)));
    device.free_memory(ManuallyDrop::into_inner(read(&self.memory)));
  }
```

And it's got a load method which is complex enough that we'll talk about it in
steps.

## Method Signature

What will we need? Well, we need and Adapter and Device like we do for a lot of
these memory things, but we'll also be telling the GPU to do stuff, so we'll
need a CommandPool and a CommandQueue. They get bound by `Capability +
Supports<Transfer>`, in other words, they have to be pools that support the
ability to transfer things around. That's actually _all_ possible pools and
queues (since graphics and compute both also support transfer), but it doesn't
really hurt to be clear what we're looking for. Lastly we need the image to be
uploading. We'll use the [image](https://docs.rs/image) crate because it's the
most commonly used one. They support most of the file formats and pixel types
you'd need.

```rust
  pub fn new<C: Capability + Supports<Transfer>>(
    adapter: &Adapter<B>, device: &D, command_pool: &mut CommandPool<B, C>, command_queue: &mut CommandQueue<B, C>,
    img: image::RgbaImage,
  ) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
    unsafe {
```

## Make A Staging Buffer

The graphics card has a lot of different memory areas that are specialized for
different tasks. What that means right now is that we can't send our image data
directly to where it needs to go. We have to make a "staging buffer", copy our
image into that, then tell the GPU to copy from the staging buffer into the
actual image memory. Yes, really.

TERMHN: CAN'T YOU HAVE IMAGES IN CPU VISIBLE MEMORY? WHY NOT DO THAT HERE? IS IT
JUST A SPEED THING? IT'S PROBABLY A SPEED THING.

For the staging buffer we can use the `BufferBundle` type, and we want the usage
to be "transfer source".

```rust
      // 1. make a staging buffer with enough memory for the image, and a
      //    transfer_src usage
      let required_bytes = size_of::<image::Rgba<u8>>() * img.width() as usize * img.height() as usize;
      let staging_bundle = BufferBundle::new(&adapter, device, required_bytes, BufferUsage::TRANSFER_SRC)?;
```

## Write To The Staging Buffer

Now that our staging buffer is created, we can "stage" the data into it.

Except [TERMHN WILL EXPLAIN HERE]

So we have to be very round-about and copy one row of pixels at a time.

```rust
      // 2. use mapping writer to put the image data into that buffer
      let limits = adapter.physical_device.limits();
      let row_alignment_mask = limits.min_buffer_copy_pitch_alignment as u32 - 1;
      let image_stride = size_of::<image::Rgba<u8>>();
      let row_pitch = (img.width() * image_stride as u32 + row_alignment_mask) & !row_alignment_mask;
      let mut writer = device
        .acquire_mapping_writer::<u8>(&staging_bundle.memory, 0..staging_bundle.requirements.size)
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't acquire a mapping writer to the staging buffer!")?;
      for y in 0..img.height() as usize {
        let row = &(*img)[y * (img.width() as usize) * image_stride..(y + 1) * (img.width() as usize) * image_stride];
        let dest_base = y * row_pitch as usize;
        writer[dest_base..dest_base + row.len()].copy_from_slice(row);
      }
      device
        .release_mapping_writer(writer)
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't release the mapping writer to the staging buffer!")?;
```

See that part where we iterate the picture rows and the writer rows in the same
direction? If we needed to flip our image data around we'd iterate one of them
in the opposite direction (doesn't matter which) and then our image would get
uploaded with a vertical flip applied.

## Make An Image

Now we make an Image on the Device with [create_image](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.1.0/gfx_hal/device/trait.Device.html#tymethod.create_image).

* `kind` looks like just the dimensionality of the image, but it's [actually
  complex enough to need a huge
  table](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkImageViewCreateInfo.html)
  of what's allowed to go with what.
* `mip_levels` is for when you do mip mapping to have more than one level of
  detail for the image. We won't do that yet, so just leave it at 1.
* `format` is the pixel format of the image. This might not match the pixel
  format of the swapchain that the image gets used with, and then the GPU will
  convert around and stuff. Thankfully our formats will probably match here.
* `tiling` affects the memory layout of the image. In this case the image will
  be purely used within the GPU, so we'll pick `Optimal` and let the GPU be
  happy.
* `usage` is an image usage (which is _similar to but not the same as_ the
  buffer usage flags), and here we want `TRANSFER_DST` (since it will be the
  destination for our staging buffer transfer) and also `SAMPLED` (since the
  fragment shader will sample from it).
* `view_caps` is if we want our view into the image to support anything special,
  but we don't need any of that.

```rust
      // 3. Make an image with transfer_dst and SAMPLED usage
      let mut the_image = device
        .create_image(
          gfx_hal::image::Kind::D2(img.width(), img.height(), 1, 1),
          1,
          Format::Rgba8Srgb,
          gfx_hal::image::Tiling::Optimal,
          gfx_hal::image::Usage::TRANSFER_DST | gfx_hal::image::Usage::SAMPLED,
          gfx_hal::image::ViewCapabilities::empty(),
        )
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't create the image!")?;
```

## Allocate Some Image Memory

Next we want to allocate some memory for the image and bind it to the image.
This works _very close_ to how it works with the `BufferBundle` type. However,
instead of memory that's `CPU_VISIBLE`, we want memory that's `DEVICE_LOCAL`.

```rust
      // 4. allocate memory for the image and bind it
      let requirements = device.get_image_requirements(&the_image);
      let memory_type_id = adapter
        .physical_device
        .memory_properties()
        .memory_types
        .iter()
        .enumerate()
        .find(|&(id, memory_type)| {
          // BIG NOTE: THIS IS DEVICE LOCAL NOT CPU VISIBLE
          requirements.type_mask & (1 << id) != 0 && memory_type.properties.contains(Properties::DEVICE_LOCAL)
        })
        .map(|(id, _)| MemoryTypeId(id))
        .ok_or("Couldn't find a memory type to support the image!")?;
      let memory = device
        .allocate_memory(memory_type_id, requirements.size)
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't allocate image memory!")?;
      device
        .bind_image_memory(&memory, 0, &mut the_image)
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't bind the image memory!")?;
```

The same thing applies here as with the `BufferBundle`, in a program with many
textures you'd need to use a sub-allocator to limit your total allocations. This
is fine for now though.

## Create An `ImageView` And `Sampler`

We don't use it immediately, but later on we'll need to have both an ImageView
and Sampler for our Image, so we'll make them right now and store them in the
`LoadedImage` struct.

TERMHN EXPLAIN WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS PLZ

```rust
      // 5. create image view and sampler
      let image_view = device
        .create_image_view(
          &the_image,
          gfx_hal::image::ViewKind::D2,
          Format::Rgba8Srgb,
          gfx_hal::format::Swizzle::NO,
          SubresourceRange {
            aspects: Aspects::COLOR,
            levels: 0..1,
            layers: 0..1,
          },
        )
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't create the image view!")?;
      let sampler = device
        .create_sampler(gfx_hal::image::SamplerInfo::new(
          gfx_hal::image::Filter::Nearest,
          gfx_hal::image::WrapMode::Tile,
        ))
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't create the sampler!")?;
```

## Create A `CommandBuffer`

We've done this step before, it's not weird. The biggest difference is that now
we're making a `OneShot` command buffer. Those other command buffers that we use
over and over are `MultiShot`. They both implement
[Shot](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.1.0/gfx_hal/command/trait.Shot.html). It's
basically what it sounds like, one can be reused and one can't. At the end of
the loading process we'll be throwing this shot away
([Hamilton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic7NqP_YGlg) would be quite upset
with us), so we'll make a `OneShot` buffer this time around.

TERMHN WHY. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE. WHAT IS THE REASON FOR DIFFERENT BUFFER TYPES AT ALL.

```rust
      // 6. create a command buffer
      let mut cmd_buffer = command_pool.acquire_command_buffer::<gfx_hal::command::OneShot>();
      cmd_buffer.begin();
```

## First Pipeline Barrier

The image memory starts with undefined values (much like memory on the CPU) but
it _also_ starts with an undefined _layout_. Which sounds a little weird, but
it's totally a thing.

Our first command into the buffer is to transition the image memory into a new
layout that's the best possible layout for being a transfer destination. What
_exactly_ that means is up to the GPU, but it knows what to do.

```rust
      // 7. Use a pipeline barrier to transition the image from empty/undefined
      //    to TRANSFER_WRITE/TransferDstOptimal
      let image_barrier = gfx_hal::memory::Barrier::Image {
        states: (gfx_hal::image::Access::empty(), Layout::Undefined)
          ..(gfx_hal::image::Access::TRANSFER_WRITE, Layout::TransferDstOptimal),
        target: &the_image,
        families: None,
        range: SubresourceRange {
          aspects: Aspects::COLOR,
          levels: 0..1,
          layers: 0..1,
        },
      };
      cmd_buffer.pipeline_barrier(
        PipelineStage::TOP_OF_PIPE..PipelineStage::TRANSFER,
        gfx_hal::memory::Dependencies::empty(),
        &[image_barrier],
      );
```

## Do The Copy

Our next command is to actually do that copy from the staging buffer (in
`CPU_VISIBLE` memory) into the image (the `DEVICE_LOCAL` memory).

```rust
      // 8. perform copy from staging buffer to image
      cmd_buffer.copy_buffer_to_image(
        &staging_bundle.buffer,
        &the_image,
        Layout::TransferDstOptimal,
        &[gfx_hal::command::BufferImageCopy {
          buffer_offset: 0,
          buffer_width: img.width(),
          buffer_height: img.height(),
          image_layers: gfx_hal::image::SubresourceLayers {
            aspects: Aspects::COLOR,
            level: 0,
            layers: 0..1,
          },
          image_offset: gfx_hal::image::Offset { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
          image_extent: gfx_hal::image::Extent {
            width: img.width(),
            height: img.height(),
            depth: 1,
          },
        }],
      );
```

## Transition The Image Into Shader Layout

Just like there's a layout for being an optimal destination, there's also a
layout for being an optimal place for a shader to read from. We've gotta issue a
pipeline barrier for this transition too.

```rust
      // 9. use pipeline barrier to transition the image to SHADER_READ access/
      //    ShaderReadOnlyOptimal layout
      let image_barrier = gfx_hal::memory::Barrier::Image {
        states: (gfx_hal::image::Access::TRANSFER_WRITE, Layout::TransferDstOptimal)
          ..(gfx_hal::image::Access::SHADER_READ, Layout::ShaderReadOnlyOptimal),
        target: &the_image,
        families: None,
        range: SubresourceRange {
          aspects: Aspects::COLOR,
          levels: 0..1,
          layers: 0..1,
        },
      };
      cmd_buffer.pipeline_barrier(
        PipelineStage::TRANSFER..PipelineStage::FRAGMENT_SHADER,
        gfx_hal::memory::Dependencies::empty(),
        &[image_barrier],
      );
```

## Submit That Buffer!

With all our command written we submit the buffer. Except we don't have a fence
for the GPU to signal us when the whole thing is done. Well, it's not like we're
uploading whole images every frame, so we'll just make a temporary fence and
then destroy it.

```rust
      // 10. Submit the cmd buffer to queue and wait for it
      cmd_buffer.finish();
      let upload_fence = device.create_fence(false).map_err(|_| "Couldn't create an upload fence!")?;
      command_queue.submit_nosemaphores(Some(&cmd_buffer), Some(&upload_fence));
      device
        .wait_for_fence(&upload_fence, core::u64::MAX)
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't wait for the fence!")?;
      device.destroy_fence(upload_fence);
```

## Destroy The Staging Buffer

We're all done, but we can't forget to clean up that staging buffer

```rust
      // 11. Destroy the staging bundle now that we're done with it
      staging_bundle.manually_drop(device);
```

## Success!

We've finally uploaded an image!

```rust
      Ok(Self {
        image: ManuallyDrop::new(the_image),
        requirements,
        memory: ManuallyDrop::new(memory),
        image_view: ManuallyDrop::new(image_view),
        sampler: ManuallyDrop::new(sampler),
        phantom: PhantomData,
      })
```

# Shading The Image Onto The Quad

To actually use this image we've got more work. Of course, that dumb graphics
pipeline of ours has to change yet again to accommodate this new thing. So we'll
have to make some changes to `create_pipeline`.

## DescriptorSetLayout

First we need a DescriptorSetLayout, which just defines the things our shaders
are going to use basically. We need a SampledImage and a Sampler. Like with
other shader stuff, the `binding` will be important later on in the shader
itself, the numbers we pick here will have to match the numbers there.

```rust
      // 1. you make a DescriptorSetLayout which is the layout of one descriptor
      //    set
      let descriptor_set_layouts: Vec<<back::Backend as Backend>::DescriptorSetLayout> = vec![unsafe {
        device
          .create_descriptor_set_layout(
            &[
              DescriptorSetLayoutBinding {
                binding: 0,
                ty: gfx_hal::pso::DescriptorType::SampledImage,
                count: 1,
                stage_flags: ShaderStageFlags::FRAGMENT,
                immutable_samplers: false,
              },
              DescriptorSetLayoutBinding {
                binding: 1,
                ty: gfx_hal::pso::DescriptorType::Sampler,
                count: 1,
                stage_flags: ShaderStageFlags::FRAGMENT,
                immutable_samplers: false,
              },
            ],
            &[],
          )
          .map_err(|_| "Couldn't make a DescriptorSetLayout")?
      }];
```

## DescriptorPool

Your actual descriptors come out of a DescriptorPool, which you make from the
Device. Unlike with the command pool, we have to decide how much we'll ever
allocate out of this thing ahead of time.

```rust
      // 2. you create a descriptor pool, and when making that descriptor pool
      //    you specify how many sets you want to be able to allocate from the
      //    pool, as well as the maximum number of each kind of descriptor you
      //    want to be able to allocate from that pool, total, for all sets.
      let mut descriptor_pool = unsafe {
        device
          .create_descriptor_pool(
            1, // sets
            &[
              gfx_hal::pso::DescriptorRangeDesc {
                ty: gfx_hal::pso::DescriptorType::SampledImage,
                count: 1,
              },
              gfx_hal::pso::DescriptorRangeDesc {
                ty: gfx_hal::pso::DescriptorType::Sampler,
                count: 1,
              },
            ],
          )
          .map_err(|_| "Couldn't create a descriptor pool!")?
      };
```

Technically you could either steps 1 or 2 first, as long as they're both done
before step 3.

## Allocate A DescriptorSet

With a layout and a pool, we're ready to allocate a DescriptorSet.

```rust
      // 3. you allocate said descriptor set from the pool you made earlier
      let descriptor_set = unsafe {
        descriptor_pool
          .allocate_set(&descriptor_set_layouts[0])
          .map_err(|_| "Couldn't make a Descriptor Set!")?
      };
```

## Bind The Descriptors Before We Draw

```rust
        encoder.bind_graphics_descriptor_sets(&self.pipeline_layout, 0, Some(self.descriptor_set.deref()), &[]);
```

## Create The Descriptors You Want To Write

At this point you'd make the actual descriptors you'd want to write. In this
case that's the Image and the Sampler that are part of our `LoadedImage`. So, in
the `HalState` startup we'll load up the image after we call `create_pipeline`.

```rust
    // 4. You create the actual descriptors which you want to write into the
    //    allocated descriptor set (in this case an image and a sampler)
    let texture = LoadedImage::new(
      &adapter,
      &device,
      &mut command_pool,
      &mut queue_group.queues[0],
      image::load_from_memory(CREATURE_BYTES).expect("Binary corrupted!").to_rgba(),
    )?;
```

This could technically be either before or after the call to `create_pipeline` (since
neither depends on the other), but since it's "step 4" in this process, and `create_pipeline` .

## Write The Descriptors Into The DescriptorSet

Once all the `Descriptor` values and the `DescriptorSet` exist at the same time
(after `create_pipeline` and after we have our `LoadedImage`), we can write the
one into the other.

```rust
    // 5. You write the descriptors into the descriptor set using
    //    write_descriptor_sets which you pass a set of DescriptorSetWrites
    //    which each write in one or more descriptors to the set
    unsafe {
      device.write_descriptor_sets(vec![
        gfx_hal::pso::DescriptorSetWrite {
          set: &descriptor_set,
          binding: 0,
          array_offset: 0,
          descriptors: Some(gfx_hal::pso::Descriptor::Image(texture.image_view.deref(), Layout::Undefined)),
        },
        gfx_hal::pso::DescriptorSetWrite {
          set: &descriptor_set,
          binding: 1,
          array_offset: 0,
          descriptors: Some(gfx_hal::pso::Descriptor::Sampler(texture.sampler.deref())),
        },
      ]);
    }
```

## Bind The Descriptor Set During Render Pass Encoding

Lastly, when we're doing all of our binding for the render pass, we have to bind
this stuff too.

```rust
        // 6. You actually bind the descriptor set in the command buffer before
        //    the draw call using bind_graphics_descriptor_sets
        encoder.bind_graphics_descriptor_sets(&self.pipeline_layout, 0, Some(self.descriptor_set.deref()), &[]);
```

We've got it a in few places, but that `deref` call there is to make the `Deref`
trait on the `ManuallyDrop` wrapper trigger, because just using `&` doesn't do
it (probably because `bind_graphics_descriptor_sets` is so generic that `rustc`
actually gets confused about what we're even trying to tell it).

Side note: here we're using `Some(thing)` instead of making an `ArrayVec` of
length 1. It's ultimately the same (since the generic here is for
`IntoIterator`), and arguably easier to use this way. However, I wanted to make
sure that you knew how to do the `ArrayVec` version, so it got shown off first.
Using `Some(thing)` is quick and easy, but it caps you at one element instead of
allowing for as many elements as you want with the `ArrayVec` (just change the
length value). Of course, if you don't know how many things you'll be passing at
compile time (for whatever reason) you can also use a normal `Vec`.

## Update The Vertex Shader

We adjust the vertex shader slightly so that it passes the UV coordinates on through.

```glsl
#version 450
layout (location = 0) in vec2 position;
layout (location = 1) in vec3 color;
layout (location = 2) in vec2 vert_uv;

layout (location = 0) out gl_PerVertex {
  vec4 gl_Position;
};
layout (location = 1) out vec3 frag_color;
layout (location = 2) out vec2 frag_uv;

void main()
{
  gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
  frag_color = color;
  frag_uv = vert_uv;
}
```

## Update The Fragment Shader

LAST STEP!

In the fragment shader we need to declare that we'll be getting this image data:

```glsl
layout(set = 0, binding = 0) uniform texture2D tex;
layout(set = 0, binding = 1) uniform sampler samp;
```

Then in `main` we form a `sampler2D` from the `texture2D` and `sampler` put
together. This lets us call the
[texture](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/texture.xhtml)
function, passing the `sampler2D` as well as the UV coordinates of that
fragment. That finally ets us a RGBA color out of the texture data.

We could output this directly, but just for fun (and to show off a little more
of what a fragment shader can do) we'll use the time value to shift between the
texture data and the rainbow color data. This is a snap to do with the
[mix](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/mix.xhtml)
function. It takes two colors, and a portion from 0.0 to 1.0 for how much the
_second_ color should determine the output (it's a linear interpolation, if
you're familiar with the term). We'll cover this in more detail later on. For
now it's okay to just know that it works.

```glsl
#version 450
layout (push_constant) uniform PushConsts {
  float time;
} push;

layout(set = 0, binding = 0) uniform texture2D tex;
layout(set = 0, binding = 1) uniform sampler samp;

layout (location = 1) in vec3 frag_color;
layout (location = 2) in vec2 frag_uv;

layout (location = 0) out vec4 color;

void main()
{
  float time01 = -0.9 * abs(sin(push.time * 0.7)) + 0.9;
  vec4 tex_color = texture(sampler2D(tex, samp), frag_uv);
  color = mix(tex_color, vec4(frag_color, 1.0), time01);
}
```

And we're finally through!
