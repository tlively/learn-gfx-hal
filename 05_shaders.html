                        <a class="header" href="#shaders" id="shaders"><h1>Shaders</h1></a>
<p>I know you've been itching for a short lesson, so let's do a short lesson.</p>
<p>This time we're talking more about Shaders. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh0Y2hVe_bw">What are
shaders?</a> We just don't know.</p>
<a class="header" href="#glsl-and-spirv" id="glsl-and-spirv"><h1>GLSL and SPIRV</h1></a>
<p>Technically you can use any number of shader languages with <code>gfx-hal</code> as long as
they can compile to SPIRV. There's many options, and even an LLVM/SPIRV
converter (<a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM">really</a>), so you could
<em>potentially</em> use a very wide range of options.</p>
<p>For <strong>now</strong> now we're using a slightly special variant of GLSL, which stands for
&quot;open Graphics Library Shader Language&quot;, be cause it's technically the official
language for OpenGL, not Vulkan. Still, everyone already knew GLSL when Vulkan
came out, and it's actually quite good at what it does, so they kept the textual
format and just specified how to compile it to a new binary format.</p>
<p>The <code>shaderc-rs</code> crate that we're using compiles the textual GLSL into the
binary SPIRV for us. More precisely, the <code>shaderc-rs</code> crate's <code>build.rs</code> file
downloads the source of the <code>shaderc</code> C++ program and builds that, then puts
those binaries deep in your <code>target/</code> directory, then when you call the crate it
invokes that program to do the actual compilation. And it fails if the binaries
aren't there. The crate itself doesn't know how to do any compilation at all.</p>
<p>If you think that sounds crazy, you're right. People are working on better
solutions, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoy4_h7Pb3M">top men</a>, I assure you,
but until then this is the best system we've got.</p>
<p>Now there's a whole lot that can be said about GLSL. You can seriously write
<a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">books</a> and <a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/">blogs</a>
and <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">demo site</a> after <a href="https://www.vertexshaderart.com/">demo
site</a> after <a href="http://glslsandbox.com/">demo
site</a> after <a href="https://www.interactiveshaderformat.com/">demo
site</a> for just GLSL.</p>
<p>We'll cover some <em>introduction</em> level GLSL in this lesson, and it's fairly
straight forward so I don't think we'll need to specifically focus on it too
much later on. It's a &quot;based on C&quot; language with minimal extensibility, so you
can learn all the limits of the language itself fairly fast.</p>
<p>However, even once you quickly pick up all the rules of the language, you should
still read the books and blogs and sites and things like that because they teach
you how to actually apply those simple rules. Like the difference between
learning how to play chess and learning to be good at playing chess.</p>
<a class="header" href="#version" id="version"><h2>Version</h2></a>
<p>The first line of all your shaders will generally be</p>
<pre><code class="language-glsl">#version 450
</code></pre>
<p>There's technically a whole lot of GLSL versions, because each release of OpenGL
has a GLSL that goes with it, but since we're not <em>really</em> using OpenGL, we just
pretend we're using version 450 since that's what <code>shaderc</code> understands.</p>
<a class="header" href="#inputs-and-outputs" id="inputs-and-outputs"><h2>Inputs and Outputs</h2></a>
<p>Next you generally want to specify your inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>In normal GLSL you don't have to specify a layout value for each input and
output, but for the GLSL that we want to compile to SPIRV you are <em>required</em> to
give a layout location for each. The general format is</p>
<pre><code class="language-glsl">layout (location = INDEX) DIRECTION TYPE NAME;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>INDEX</code> values are just integer values. They're basically arbitrary, but
your Rust code and GLSL code must <strong>all</strong> agree on whatever you pick.
<ul>
<li>With a Vertex shader, the <code>AttributeDesc</code> determines the locations for
passing CPU side data into into GLSL data at the start of the process.</li>
<li>With a Fragment shader, the <code>SubpassDesc</code> determines the locations for
fragment outputs becoming framebuffer data at the end of the process.</li>
<li><em>Between</em> shaders the locations and variable outputs from one stage need to
match the locations and names of the next stage any time you want to pass
data between rendering stages.</li>
<li>There's a (rather small) limit on how many location slots you're allowed,
and if you use a struct type it can consume more than one slot. <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Layout_Qualifier_(GLSL)#Program_separation_linkage">The
Khronos
wiki</a>
has some more about the rules here if you want to know the exact details. I
don't expect any of our early lessons to hit these limits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>DIRECTION</code> is a keyword: one of <code>in</code>, <code>out</code>, or <code>uniform</code>. Technically
there are other things you could put here but they're aliases for one of those
three so let's stick to the basics. An <code>in</code> value comes from a previous stage
(or the vertex buffer data, for the Vertex Shader), and an <code>out</code> value goes to
the next stage (or the framebuffer, for the Fragment Shader). A <code>uniform</code> is a
special kind of read-only value that we'll get to a little farther down the page.</li>
<li>The <code>TYPE</code> is a variable type, using C style names, so it's stuff like
<code>float</code>, <code>int</code>, and <code>uint</code>, not <code>f32</code>, <code>i32</code>, and <code>u32</code>. There's also <code>vecN</code>
where N is 2, 3, or 4 if you want a float vector, and you can have integer
vectors and such as well. You can even declare structs using the C style where
the block of fields is written <code>{ type1 field1; type2 field2; ... }</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>NAME</code> is just a name for the variable. Usually variable names are
camelCase with GLSL code that you find in the wild, but snake_case is fine too.</li>
</ul>
<p>In GLSL you'd normally have access to a few magical values that you can read and
write from, but not all of that translates cleanly with the <code>shaderc</code> compiler.
In our case, the thing that we need to be the most aware of is that instead of
writing to a magical and undeclared <code>gl_Position</code> value during the vertex shader
to determine a vertex's on-screen position, we need to declare and use a special
output like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-glsl">layout (location = 0) out gl_PerVertex {
  vec4 gl_Position;
};
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#functions" id="functions"><h2>Functions</h2></a>
<p>Your GLSL can have any number of functions that you like, declared in the C
style where the output is on the left, then the function names and arguments.</p>
<p>At minimum each shader needs an &quot;entry point&quot;, as you may recall from the
pipeline declaration we did. By tradition it's just called <code>main</code>, and that's
probably good enough so we'll go with that in our shaders.</p>
<a class="header" href="#final-note" id="final-note"><h2>Final Note</h2></a>
<p>Just saying, in a normal project you'd probably want to have your shader code in
separate files, not directly as string constants. If you use a file extension
like .glsl, or maybe .vert and .frag, then your editor will probably have a mode
for syntax highlighting and other support for the GLSL format. That's a lot
better than a string literal. Somewhere in your Rust code you use the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_str.html">include_str!</a> macro, like
this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
static VERT_SRC: &amp;'static str = include_str!(&quot;dwarf.vert&quot;);
static FRAG_SRC: &amp;'static str = include_str!(&quot;dwarf.frag&quot;);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>And then that's how you'll have your shader source available.</p>
<p>Please understand that I'm using embedded string literals just because it's
easiest <em>for example purposes</em> to have each example be a single file at a time.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adding-a-vertex-attribute-for-color" id="adding-a-vertex-attribute-for-color"><h1>Adding A Vertex Attribute For Color</h1></a>
<p>So let's add a second attribute to our vertex data. We'll add an attribute for
color. Make a fancy rainbow triangle.</p>
<a class="header" href="#update-shader-code" id="update-shader-code"><h2>Update Shader Code</h2></a>
<p>First we update our shaders to use the new color attribute. A full color output
is of course RGBA (vec4), but as input we'll just give RGB and then let the
fragment shader add that A=1.0 in its output.</p>
<p>So our <em>input</em> locations are 0 (position) and 1 (color), and our <em>output</em>
locations are also 0 (the magical gl_Position) and 1 (frag_color for the
fragment shader). The fact that the position information is location 0 for both
inputs and outputs isn't special, you could swap it around if you wanted. Like
with the previous lesson, our fragment shader just promotes the 2D input into a
flat 3D output (which is actually a <code>vec4</code>, and I'll get to why that is in
the lesson on coordinate spaces).</p>
<p>The other line of <code>main</code>, saying <code>frag_color = color;</code> might look a little
silly, but there's a lot of magic wrapped up in that shorthand. It's <em>not</em> a
direct copy of the data, it's what makes that interpolation happen when more
than one fragment is generated by a vertex. If we wanted to have a direct copy
without interpolation we could specify the <code>flat</code> keyword on the output here
(eg: <code>layout (location = 1) flat out vec3 frag_color;</code>). In that case, each
fragment will use the vertex shader outputs of a particular vertex element (the
spec calls it the &quot;<a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Primitive#Provoking_vertex">provoking
index</a>&quot;). Since
integer values can't be interpolated, you actually <em>must</em> specify <code>flat</code> with
integers that pass between shader stages.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub const VERTEX_SOURCE: &amp;str = &quot;#version 450
layout (location = 0) in vec2 position;
layout (location = 1) in vec3 color;

layout (location = 0) out gl_PerVertex {
  vec4 gl_Position;
};
layout (location = 1) out vec3 frag_color;

void main()
{
  gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
  frag_color = color;
}&quot;;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>For our fragment shader, we accept a single input, with the <em>exact same
location</em> as the output from the vertex shader. That's how the system knows to
make them match. (In some older GLSL versions you also could match up variables
by name, but SPIRV only goes by location.) This means that we actually don't
have a location 0 input for our fragment shader, and that's totally fine. Our
output is at location 0 (matching out <code>SubpassDesc</code>) vec4 (which is &quot;RGBA&quot;,
since it'll be treated as a color). We'll sensibly call it <code>color</code>. We just
promote the RGB color into an RGBA color by giving it an alpha of 1.0 (&quot;fully
opaque&quot;).</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub const FRAGMENT_SOURCE: &amp;str = &quot;#version 450
layout (location = 1) in vec3 frag_color;

layout (location = 0) out vec4 color;

void main()
{
  color = vec4(frag_color,1.0);
}&quot;;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="#make-triangle-produce-the-new-data-format" id="make-triangle-produce-the-new-data-format"><h2>Make <code>Triangle</code> Produce The New Data Format</h2></a>
<p>Next we'll add a method to our <code>Triangle</code> type so that it can give us the
positions interleaved with some color data. We'll just have one corner be red,
one be green, and one blue.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
  pub fn vertex_attributes(self) -&gt; [f32; 3 * (2 + 3)] {
    let [[a, b], [c, d], [e, f]] = self.points;
    [
      a, b, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, // red
      c, d, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, // green
      e, f, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, // blue
    ]
  }
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="#create-a-pipeline-with-more-attributes" id="create-a-pipeline-with-more-attributes"><h2>Create A Pipeline With More Attributes</h2></a>
<p>Now we want to support the color attribute in our <code>create_pipeline</code> function.
That's pretty easy, we just change how the the <code>vertex_buffer</code> and <code>attributes</code>
values are defined.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>vertex_buffers</code> needs to have a bigger <code>stride</code> than before, because the
stride between elements is now &quot;five floats&quot; instead of the previous &quot;two
floats&quot;. We'll also cast the <code>usize</code> to the <code>ElemStride</code> type alias instead of
<code>u32</code>. It's the same type, but it lets future readers know that we probably
knew what we were doing (but only probably).</li>
<li><code>attributes</code> needs an entire second <code>AttributeDesc</code> entry to describe the
color data. The location is easy enough to understand, as is the binding. The
element format is now <code>Rgb32Float</code>, since this is three floats, and the offset
is the sum of the previous attributes up to this point.</li>
</ul>

<p>This setup, with <code>[(position, color), (position, color), ..]</code> is called
&quot;interleaved&quot; data. You can also have non-interleaved data by laying out all the
positions and then all the colors, and so on. Then you adjust your <code>stride</code> and
<code>offset</code> value to match that. We'll use interleaved data just because I
personally think it's easier to think about, and even the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification_Best_Practices#Formatting_VBO_Data">Khronos
wiki</a>
doesn't take a clear stance either way.</p>
<a class="header" href="#colors" id="colors"><h2>Colors!</h2></a>
<p>That's pretty much it. Didn't I promise that <em>eventually</em> it'd get easier to
enhance the program? That was pretty easy.</p>
<p>So easy... that we'll keep going and add a little bit more to the lesson.</p>
<a class="header" href="#push-constants" id="push-constants"><h1>Push Constants</h1></a>
<p>Last lesson I said that most of the time you don't re-upload vertex data every
frame. That's because usually you'd have a single model (an &quot;iconic triangle&quot; if
you will) and then you'd tell the shader what animation frame, or position, or
global light level, or other detail to use during the drawing without touching
the model data directly. It doesn't seem like a big difference right now when
there's only 3 vertex entries in one triangle, but if there's <em>thousands</em> of
vertex entries, and there's <em>tens</em> of copies of that model that have to show up
in the scene, well you'd rather be doing all that math on your GPU (with dozens
of ALUs) than on your CPU (with only a handful of ALUs). That's like, the whole
<em>point</em> of the GPU after all.</p>
<p>So how do we know about these special global values during a draw call? They get
placed into things called <em>uniforms</em>, that's what the <code>uniform</code> keyword is for
in GLSL. When GLSL was used for OpenGL there were just &quot;uniforms&quot;, but with the
introduction of Vulkan now we've got both &quot;Uniform Buffers&quot; (like the old
uniforms) and also &quot;Push Constants&quot; (a fancy new thing). Uniforms get set before
a draw call and then they're a fixed, read-only value for that entire draw call.
No changes per-vertex or per-fragment or anything else. Any shader can access
that uniform, if it's been correctly configured in your pipeline setup.</p>
<p>As I said, push constants are newer, so older 3D books might not mention them if
you pick one up for some light technical reading, but they work the same way as
a uniform buffer. The biggest difference is that push constants can be assumed
to be significantly faster to update (because of where their physical memory is
on the GPU's card), and also they are somewhat easier to use (because there's no
faffing about with buffers), but you only get a <em>very</em> limited amount of push
constant space. With <code>gfx-hal</code> you can only use 128 <strong>bytes</strong> of push constant
space. The Vulkan spec assures that you have at least that much, and many
cards offer more these days, but currently <code>gfx-hal</code> has no way to ask the
graphics card exactly how much it supports. It's on the TODO list for 0.2.</p>
<p>As a demo of how to use push constants, we'll record a <code>std::time::Instant</code> at
the creation of our <code>HalState</code> and then use the time since that Instant to shift
our triangle towards black.</p>
<a class="header" href="#add-it-to-our-halstate" id="add-it-to-our-halstate"><h2>Add It To Our <code>HalState</code></h2></a>
<p>We first add an
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html">Instant</a> field to our
<code>HalState</code> and then use <code>Instant::now</code> to get an Instant while we're
initializing our HalState value.</p>
<p>Before we record the command buffer, we'll decide the current time value as an
<code>f32</code>. Please note that <code>f32</code> is actually a <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/dont-store-that-in-a-float/">very
bad</a>
way to store time in the long term (that's why <code>Duration</code> has two integer values
instead of a single float value), but it's fine for our short term animation
purposes here.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
    // DETERMINE THE TIME DATA
    let duration = Instant::now().duration_since(self.creation_instant);
    let time_f32 = duration.as_secs() as f32 + duration.subsec_nanos() as f32 * 1e-9;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>And just after we bind the vertex buffer, we also push the graphics constant:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
        encoder.bind_vertex_buffers(0, buffers);
        encoder.push_graphics_constants(
          &amp;self.pipeline_layout,
          ShaderStageFlags::FRAGMENT,
          0,
          &amp;[time_f32.to_bits()],
        );
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The important part is that we have to remember to adjust our pipeline definition
as well. Remember how the <code>push_constants</code> value was an empty Vec? We need one
entry now (one push constant).</p>
<p>The format of the Vec is pretty easy: You give <code>(ShaderStageFlags, Range)</code>
tuples, with the ShaderStageFlags signifying what stage the push const will
appear in, and the Range specifying what range of that <code>push_graphics_constants</code>
slice we made will be accessed during that stage. Our stage is
<code>ShaderStageFlags::FRAGMENT</code>, and our range is to just use index 0 (which is
<code>0..1</code> in Rust's Range notation, don't forget).</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
      let push_constants = vec![(ShaderStageFlags::FRAGMENT, 0..1)];
      let layout = unsafe {
        device
          .create_pipeline_layout(&amp;descriptor_set_layouts, push_constants)
          .map_err(|_| &quot;Couldn't create a pipeline layout&quot;)?
      };
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="#add-it-to-the-shader-code" id="add-it-to-the-shader-code"><h2>Add It To The Shader Code</h2></a>
<p>Adding the push constants to a shader is pretty easy, but there are few rules.
All of your push constants appear in a single block with the special layout
value of <code>push_constant</code>. This block isn't <code>in</code> or <code>out</code>, instead it's
<code>uniform</code>. After that you give a name for the block type, the block itself, and then
the name that we're going to access it under. If you haven't programmed in C
before this, it may seem weird, but they think it's normal. We just have to go
with it.</p>
<p>Since we want a single <code>f32</code> to be the time, we define it as a block that holds
a single <code>float</code> value (the GLSL equivalent) which we call <code>time</code>. Then we
take <code>push.time</code> (think of it like they're all stored within a global <code>push</code>
struct), do some funny math on that so that it ends up as a 0.0 to 1.0 value
(since color channels are supposed to be in that range), and make a vec4. We can
multiply the vec4 from our time with the vec4 for our <code>frag_color</code>, and it does
a component-wise multiplication (a.x * b.x, a.y * b.y, etc). Then we shove the
result out the door. Bam, now our triangle shifts between black and rainbow.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub const FRAGMENT_SOURCE: &amp;str = &quot;#version 450
layout (push_constant) uniform PushConsts {
  float time;
} push;

layout (location = 1) in vec3 frag_color;

layout (location = 0) out vec4 color;

void main()
{
  float time01 = -0.9 * abs(sin(push.time * 0.9)) + 0.9;
  color = vec4(frag_color,1.0) * vec4(time01,time01,time01,1.0);
}&quot;;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="#uniform-buffers" id="uniform-buffers"><h1>Uniform Buffers</h1></a>
<p>Like I said, there's a harsh limit on your push constant space. If you want more
global data than you can fit into your push constants you need to setup a
Uniform Buffer.</p>
<p>However, I also promised to keep this lesson short, and we'll be using uniform
buffers soon enough I'm sure, so we <em>won't</em> go into them right now. Knowing
about push constants already teaches you about the general idea of uniform data,
so we've covered enough to stop here.</p>
